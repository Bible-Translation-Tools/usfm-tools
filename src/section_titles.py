# Utility functions for detecting section titles.
# The following factors are useful in recognizing possible section titles:
#   Do we expect headings at all.
#   Short phrases or sentences, especially if it has no sentence-ending punctuation.
#   No more than one sentence-final punctuation.
#   On a line by itself (as opposed to appended to verse text).
#   Not split over two lines.
#   Title Case or ALL CAPS.
#   Parentheses or braces.
#   Distance from previous section heading.
#   At the beginning or end of a chunk.
#   More likely before verse 1 of a chapter.
